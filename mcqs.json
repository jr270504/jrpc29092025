    "question": "During the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, which set of products is specifically generated by the non-cyclic photophosphorylation pathway (Z-scheme) but not by the cyclic pathway?",
    "options": [
      "ATP and Oxygen only",
      "NADPH and Oxygen",
      "ATP, NADPH, and Oxygen",
      "ATP and NADPH only"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "NADPH and Oxygen",
    "explanation": "Non-cyclic photophosphorylation involves both Photosystem I and II. It results in the photolysis of water (releasing Oxygen) and the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. Both cyclic and non-cyclic pathways produce ATP, so ATP is not unique to the non-cyclic pathway. Therefore, the unique products distinguishing it from the cyclic pathway (which produces only ATP) are NADPH and Oxygen.",

      "2 ATP and 4 NADH",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "2 ATP and 2 NADH",
    "explanation": "Glycolysis (occurring in the cytoplasm) produces a total of 4 ATP molecules through substrate-level phosphorylation. However, 2 ATP molecules are consumed during the preparatory phase. Thus, the net gain is 2 ATP. Additionally, 2 NAD+ molecules are reduced to form 2 NADH. The correct net yield is 2 ATP and 2 NADH.",

    "correct_answer": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP)",
    "explanation": "In the Calvin Cycle (C3 pathway), the 5-carbon sugar Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) acts as the CO2 acceptor. The enzyme Rubisco catalyzes the fixation of CO2 to RuBP, which then immediately splits into two molecules of 3-Phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). PEP is the acceptor in C4 plants, not C3.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Chlorophyll 'a' has a methyl group (-CH3), whereas Chlorophyll 'b' has a carbonyl group (-CHO) in the porphyrin ring, altering their absorption peaks.",
    "explanation": "The structural difference between the two chlorophylls is at the C7 position of the porphyrin ring: Chlorophyll 'a' has a methyl group (-CH3), while Chlorophyll 'b' has a carbonyl/aldehyde group (-CHO). This slight structural difference shifts their absorption spectra, allowing them to absorb different wavelengths of light (Chl 'a' peaks at ~662nm/430nm, Chl 'b' at ~642nm/453nm).",
